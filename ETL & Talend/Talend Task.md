## 1. ADF activities vs Talend Components
### Orchestration
#### Talend
- Talend has tPostJob, tPreJob and tRunJob to orchestrate the jobs within Talend
#### ADF
- We have activities like Execute Pipeline, Wait, If Condition, ForEach, Until, Switch, Web, Lookup, Get Metadata
### Custom Components
#### Talend
- Talend has tJava, tGroovy, tJavaFlex, tSetGlobalVar, these enables us to create custom components with the underlying language in Talend
#### ADF
- We can leverage Azure functions from Azure and call them from the ADF pipeline for complex transformation that's not supported natively by ADF
- We can use `Web Activity` to interact with services with a REST API
### File Components
#### Talend
- Talend has various components such as **tFileInputDelimited**, **tFileInput Excel**, **tMySqlInput**, **tFileOutputDelimited**, **tMySqlOutput** for performing file operations
- We can also leverage the use of custom components for file operation needs
#### ADF
- ADF has CopyActivity which copies from a destination to sink, and support various file formats and delimited types too
- We can also leverage azure functions to build custom file operation needs
- We can also use Azure blob storage activities to interact with files on azure blob storage


### Logs and Error components
#### Talend
- **tlogRow**, **tAssert**, **tDie**, **tLogCatcher**, **tLogRow**, **tWarn** are few of the available components for error and log operations in Talend
#### ADF
- Azure Monitor can be used to collect, analyze, and act on telemetry data from ADF, including logs and metrics.
- We can call an Azure Function from the pipeline to handle errors or log specific information if an activity fails.
- ADF allows you to debug pipelines in a development environment to test and troubleshoot data flows and activities before running them in production.
### Internet components
#### Talend
- tSendEmail, tHttpRequest are the components that can be used to perform internet-related operations during the job.
#### ADF
- We can integrate ADF with **Azure Logic Apps** to send emails or we can use **Azure Functions** to send emails.
- ADF has a built-in Web activity that allows us to make HTTP requests to external services, similar to tHttpRequest in Talend

## 3. ETL and ELT: Key Differences and Similarities
Extract, Load, Transform (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) are processes used to move data from one system to another and transform it into a format suitable for analysis or other purposes.
### Data transformation:
- In ETL, data transformation is performed before the data is loaded into the target system.
- In ELT, the transformation is performed after the data is loaded into the target system. The data is loaded into the target system and then transformed using tools and resources.
### Data volume: 
- ETL is typically used for smaller data volumes, as the ETL tool performs the data transformation, which may have limited processing power. 
- ELT is better suited for more extensive data volumes, as the target system performs the transformation, which may have more robust resources for handling large data sets.
### Data latency
- ETL processes can be slower, as the data transformation is performed before the data is loaded into the target system. 
- ELT processes can be faster, as the data is loaded into the target system first and then transformed, which can reduce the time it takes to complete the process.

ETL and ELT are both practical approaches for moving and changing data. The choice between the two will depend on the project's specific needs, including the volume and complexity of the data, the resources available, and the desired speed of the process.
## 4. SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
- SSIS, or SQL Server Integration Services, is a Microsoft data integration and workflow platform.
- SSIS can be used for ETL operations, Data integration, data migration and automating workflows
### The Differences between SSIS and ADF
- SSIS and ADF are very similar in many ways regarding their functionalities but ADF is optimised for cloud environments and SSIS is tailored for on premises solutions
- **Deployment and Hosting** 
	- ADF is cloud based, fully managed and operated in the cloud
	- SSUS runs on premises, on tom of local servers or VMs
- **Scalability and Maintenance**
	- SSIS requires additional hardware resources and manual configuration. Maintenance is handled locally.
	- ADF scales automatically based on demand and requires minimal maintenance due to its managed nature.
- **Pricing:**
	• **SSIS:** Typically involves licensing costs for SQL Server and infrastructure costs for hosting and running the SSIS packages.
	• **ADF:** Pricing is based on a pay-as-you-go model, with costs associated with data movement, pipeline execution, and other services.
